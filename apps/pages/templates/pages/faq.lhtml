<h2>{{ _('Add-on Questions') }}</h2>
<dl class="faq">
<dt>{{ _('What is an Add-on?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _("Add-ons let you add features which aren't part of the standard
application. Themes change appearance without changing functionality. Search
Plugins and Dictionaries/Language Packs add additional search engines and
language support. Extensions ad d more extensive features to the browser; some
add simple toolbars while others can add a wide range of new features.") }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('Are add-ons easy to install?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _("Yes! Add-ons are very easy to install. They're generally much smaller
than a normal application and download very quickly. If you don't like one, they
are just as easy to remove or disable. Also, if an update is available for one
of your add-ons, Firefox will inform you and let you upgrade with one click.")
}}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('How do I manage an add-on?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('In Firefox, go to "Add-ons" in the Tools menu to manage Themes and
Extensions. If your Extension has special options, you can see them in the
Extensions section of the Add-ons window. From here, you can also disable and
uninstall add-ons. Dictionaries are installed as Extensions. Search Plugins can
be managed in the Search Bar.') }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('Can add-ons make Firefox slower?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('In most cases, add-ons do not cause a perceivable slowdown in Firefox.
However, since they are applications some may affect the performance of Firefox
depending on your system configuration. If you suspect that an add-on is
affecting the way Firefox runs on your machine try disabling it.') }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('Why would I disable an add-on?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _("Disabling an add-on prevents it from loading when you start Firefox,
but it doesn't remove the add-on or any of its settings. Enabling the add-on
again will bring it back to where it was when you disabled it. For add-ons that
you want to turn off without removing, disabling is the way to go.") }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _("How do I backup all of the add-ons and themes that I've installed?") }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('You can backup your profile directory which will also backup your
add-ons and themes. A third party application like MozBackup can help you with
this.') }}</dd>
</dl>

<h2>{{ _('Website questions') }}</h2>
<dl class="faq">
<dt>{{ _('I see several add-ons which provide the same capabilities. How do I decide which one is best?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _("In general, you can look at ratings and downloads which will give you
an idea. Good add-ons tend to be downloaded more than bad ones. However, it's
also easy to install both add-ons and decide which one you want to use. You may
decide after trying them that you want to use both!") }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _("I see a great add-on but it says that it's only compatible with Firefox 2.x. Can I still install it in Firefox 3.x?") }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _("In general, no. Firefox 3.x has a number of new features and a large
majority of add-on developers have updated their add-ons to support 3.x. If the
add-on only supports Firefox 2, try searching for that add-on's title. In many
cases there will be a new version that supports Firefox 3 with the same or
similar title.") }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('I installed a new theme but would like to revert back to the Firefox default theme. How do I do that?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('Go to "Add-ons" in the "Tools" menu. Click the "Themes" section and
from here you can select the default theme, or any others you have installed.')
}}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('If I have an issue with an add-on, should I contact Mozilla?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('Add-ons, with a few exceptions, are created by the community and not
Mozilla. The best thing to do is to contact the developer directly with your
question. To find contact info for a developer, click their name in the by line
on the Add-on listing page.') }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _('How are add-ons reviewed?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('Public add-ons are reviewed by our dedicated and talented editorial
team. They review the code of all public add-ons and also test the add-ons to
make sure that they are accurately described.') }}</dd>

<dt>{{ _("I've upgraded to Firefox 3.5 but my add-on no longer works? Why is that?") }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _("Most of our add-ons are now Firefox 3.5 compatible, and every day more
are added. If your add-on worked on 3.0 but not 3.5, chances are they're already
working on it. When they do upgrade their add-on, Firefox will notify you about
the upgrade.") }}</dd>

<dt id="experimental-addons">{{ _('What are experimental add-ons?') }}</dt>
<dd>
    <p>{{ _('Experimental add-ons are newer add-ons which have not yet undergone
    our public review process.  Many of these add-ons may be in prototype form.
    Since they are untested by our editorial team, they may be alpha, beta or
    pre-production in quality, performance and features.') }}</p>
    <p>{{ _('Caution should be used when installing experimental add-ons, as
    they have not been tested by an editor and may harm your computer
    configuration.') }}</p>
</dd>

<dt id="recognizing-experimental-addons">{{ _('How do I know an experimental add-on when I see one on the site?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('Experimental add-ons are marked with an "experimental" label and show a warning when you install them.') }}</dd>

<dt id="recommended-addons">{{ _('What are Recommended and Featured add-ons?') }}</dt>
<dd>{{ _('The AMO team recommends a set of add-ons which represent some of the
best add-ons in terms of utility and overall experience.  These Recommended
add-ons appear on the individual category pages.  Some of these add-ons are also
rotated onto the front page of AMO as Featured add-ons.  This is by no means a
comprehensive list, and we update the list monthly to continue to show our users
a fresh set of add-ons.  Some things we consider when we recommend add-ons:
quality, popularity, uniqueness, and whether or not the add-on has already been
recommended.') }}</dd>

<dt id="beta-addons">{{ _('What are Beta add-ons?') }}</dt>
<dd>
    <p>{{ _('Beta add-ons are unreviewed versions which represent the latest
    work of an add-on author. While different authors have different standards
    for beta code quality, you should assume that these add-ons are less stable
        than the general add-on releases.') }}</p>
    <p>{% trans %}Please note that when you install an add-on from the "Beta Version"
    section of an add-on's listing, you will continue to receive updates for
    that add-on as they become available. Like the initial version you
    installed, all beta releases are unreviewed by Mozilla and may harm your
    computer.{% endtrans %}</p>
